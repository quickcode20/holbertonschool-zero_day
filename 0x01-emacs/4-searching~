With SSH, you can have any number of windows. I recommend that you start by opening one window in which you run a program and another window for editing. Edit a program in the edit window. Then save it--use C-x C-s--and then compile it and run it in the other window. Just click in a window to make it active. Note that you don't have to exit the editor--you have to save, but you can leave the editor there while you run the program. It is convenient to be able to see the program while you run it. It is also convenient to be able to start editing by just clicking in the edit window. Sometimes it helps to be able to see the execution output while you are editing. This is especially true if you compile and get a bunch of error messages--you can see the error messages while you edit the program to make the corrections.
